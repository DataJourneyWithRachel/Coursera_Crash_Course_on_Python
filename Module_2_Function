#Complete the first line of the “print_seconds” function so that it accepts three parameters: hours, minutes, and seconds.
#Remember, to define a function, you use the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.
#The function parameters go inside the parentheses in the function definition, and they represent the values that will be given to the function when it is called.
#Also remember that the print function is a built-in Python function that outputs its arguments to the console. 
#You call a function by using its name followed by parentheses, with the arguments for the function inside the parentheses.

def print_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
    print(hours*3600+minutes*60+seconds)
print_seconds(1,2,3)
